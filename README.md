# LedgerFS üè¶

> **‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT** - This is a proof-of-concept implementation and should not be used in production environments.

A cryptographically verifiable, append-only, event-sourced ledger system designed for core banking and e-money applications. LedgerFS aims to outperform traditional RDBMS in audit-focused, high-throughput, tamper-evident environments while providing inherent regulatory compliance.

## üéØ Project Vision

LedgerFS is designed to be the foundation for next-generation financial systems that require:

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Every transaction is cryptographically signed and verifiable
- **Append-Only Immutability**: No data can be modified or deleted, ensuring complete audit trails
- **High-Throughput Performance**: Target >50,000 TPS with <100ms P95 write latency
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in support for PSD2, Basel III, and e-money safeguarding
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete system state reconstruction from immutable event log
- **FUSE Integration**: Filesystem interface for seamless integration with existing tools

## üöÄ Current Status

This project is in **early experimental development**. Current implementations include:

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

- **Core Event System**: Comprehensive event schema with cryptographic hashing
- **Event Store**: RocksDB-based LSM tree storage with append-only semantics
- **Batch Processing**: High-throughput batching system targeting >50K TPS
- **FUSE Filesystem**: Basic filesystem interface for ledger data access
- **Serialization**: Optimized binary serialization with LZ4 compression
- **Project Infrastructure**: Modular Rust workspace architecture

### üîÑ In Progress

- **Read Optimization**: Performance tuning for <50ms P95 read latency
- **Command Processing**: CQRS command handling and validation
- **Merkle Trees**: Cryptographic verification and tamper detection
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Crash recovery and consistency checking

### üìã Planned Features

- **Cryptographic Chaining**: Block-chain inspired event chaining
- **Read Models**: Optimized query interfaces for different use cases
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time event distribution and replication
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated compliance reporting tools
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Comprehensive performance testing suite

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LedgerFS uses a modular architecture built in Rust:

```
ledgerfs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ledgerfs-core/          # Core types, events, and traits
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ledgerfs-event-store/   # Event storage and batch processing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ledgerfs-fuse/          # FUSE filesystem implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ledgerfs-command/       # Command processing (planned)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ledgerfs-query/         # Read models and queries (planned)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ledgerfs-crypto/        # Cryptographic operations (planned)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                       # Documentation and specifications
```

### Key Technologies

- **Storage**: RocksDB with LSM trees for high-throughput writes
- **Serialization**: Bincode with LZ4 compression for performance
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for high-concurrency operations
- **Filesystem**: FUSE for seamless OS integration
- **Cryptography**: SHA-256 hashing with planned Merkle tree verification

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- FUSE development libraries (`libfuse-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- RocksDB development libraries

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ledgerfs.git
cd ledgerfs

# Build all crates
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build FUSE binary
cargo build --bin ledgerfs-fuse
```

### Testing the FUSE Filesystem

```bash
# Create mount point
mkdir /tmp/ledgerfs_mount

# Mount the filesystem
./target/debug/ledgerfs-fuse /tmp/ledgerfs_mount

# In another terminal, explore the filesystem
ls -la /tmp/ledgerfs_mount/

# Unmount when done
fusermount -u /tmp/ledgerfs_mount
```

## üìä Performance Targets
