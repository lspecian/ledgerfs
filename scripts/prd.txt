Product Requirements Document (PRD) for LedgerFS MVP: A Cryptographically Verifiable, Append-Only, Event-Sourced Ledger for Core Banking and E-Money Applications

I. Executive Summary
LedgerFS represents a pioneering advancement in financial technology, designed as a cryptographically verifiable, append-only, event-sourced ledger system. This innovative architecture is specifically engineered to meet the rigorous demands of core banking and e-money applications, prioritizing tamper-evidence, high-throughput transaction processing, and comprehensive auditability.

The strategic imperative of the LedgerFS Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to unequivocally validate its core premise: that it surpasses traditional RDBMS in environments where auditability, high transaction volumes, and tamper-evident data are paramount. Simultaneously, the MVP must demonstrate full adherence to critical regulatory frameworks, including PSD2, Basel III, and e-money safeguarding directives.

LedgerFS distinguishes itself through several key capabilities:

Cryptographic Attestation: At its core, LedgerFS employs advanced cryptographic hashing, specifically SHA-256, and Merkle tree data structures to construct an immutable, verifiable chain of all transactions. This mechanism provides an irrefutable, attestable proof of data integrity to auditors, regulators, and other business parties.

Append-Only and Event-Sourced Core: The system's foundational append-only nature ensures that once a financial event or transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This preserves a complete and unalterable history of all financial activities, which is indispensable for robust audit trails and regulatory compliance.

High-Throughput Design: LedgerFS is architected for write-heavy workloads, leveraging modern data structures such as Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees, which are optimized for efficient writes by minimizing disk I/O and complex balancing operations. This design aims to achieve significantly higher transaction processing speeds compared to traditional RDBMS.

Inherent Compliance: The system's design is intrinsically aligned with regulatory demands. Its immutable audit trail and verifiable data lineage directly support requirements such as PSD2's Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and open banking initiatives, Basel III's emphasis on data integrity for capital adequacy and risk management, and e-money safeguarding rules for segregated and identifiable customer funds.

II. Objectives & Success Criteria

A. Performance Validation
The primary aim is to achieve and demonstrate significantly higher transaction throughput and lower latency for core ledger operations, such as account debits and credits, especially in high-contention, audit-focused scenarios, when compared against a PostgreSQL baseline.

Success Criteria:
- Throughput: The system must sustain a minimum of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) for core ledger entries under simulated peak load conditions.
- Latency: The P95 transaction latency for ledger writes must be under 100 milliseconds (ms), and for balance queries, it must be under 50 ms.
- Scalability: The MVP must demonstrate horizontal scalability of its write path, proving its ability to accommodate increasing transaction volumes without significant performance degradation.

B. Cryptographic Verifiability
This objective focuses on implementing and demonstrating robust cryptographic proof generation and verification mechanisms for all ledger entries, ensuring the integrity and non-repudiation of financial data.

Success Criteria:
- Merkle Tree Integrity: The system must successfully generate Merkle roots for all transaction batches and cryptographically chain these roots, forming a continuous and verifiable ledger.
- Digest Generation & Storage: Database digests, representing the cryptographically hashed transactions and the state of the database, must be periodically generated and securely stored outside the primary database in tamper-proof storage.
- Inclusion Proofs: The system must provide an API that allows for the generation and verification of inclusion proofs for individual transactions or specific account balances against the published Merkle root and stored digests.

C. Core Compliance Readiness
This objective ensures that the MVP's design inherently supports key data integrity, auditability, and record-keeping requirements mandated by PSD2, Basel III, and e-money safeguarding regulations.

Success Criteria:
- Immutable Audit Trail: All state changes within the system must be recorded as immutable events, providing a complete historical log that enables full reconstruction of past states and comprehensive auditability.
- Fund Identification: The system's design must support the precise allocation and identification of individual customer funds, even when held in aggregated safeguarding accounts.
- Real-time Monitoring Hooks: The system must provide robust interfaces or data streams for real-time transaction monitoring.
