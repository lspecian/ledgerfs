LedgerFS MVP: Cryptographically Verifiable Ledger with FUSE Integration

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
LedgerFS is a cryptographically verifiable, append-only, event-sourced ledger system for core banking and e-money applications. The MVP focuses on demonstrating superior performance over traditional RDBMS while providing inherent regulatory compliance through immutable audit trails and cryptographic verification.

KEY OBJECTIVES
1. Performance: Achieve >50,000 TPS with <100ms P95 write latency, <50ms P95 read latency
2. Cryptographic Verifiability: Merkle tree-based proof generation and verification
3. FUSE Integration: Filesystem interface for ledger data access
4. Compliance: Support PSD2, Basel III, and e-money safeguarding requirements

CORE FEATURES (MVP)

1. Event Store & Core Ledger
- Append-only event storage using LSM trees
- Account creation and management
- Atomic debit/credit transactions
- Balance inquiries with optimized read models
- Historical state reconstruction from events

2. Cryptographic Attestation
- SHA-256 transaction hashing
- Merkle tree generation for transaction batches
- Cryptographic chaining of blocks
- External digest storage for tamper-proof verification
- Inclusion proof generation and verification APIs

3. FUSE Filesystem Interface
- Mount layout: /ledgerfs/accounts/acc_001/balance.json, tx.log
- Mount layout: /ledgerfs/transactions/tx_0001.json
- Mount layout: /ledgerfs/docs/tx_0001/metadata.json
- Read-only filesystem access initially
- RBAC permission mapping
- Zero-copy memory mapping where supported

4. Performance & Benchmarking
- Macro benchmarks: end-to-end transaction processing
- Micro benchmarks: event log, hash chain, snapshot performance
- FUSE access benchmarks: <10ms cold, <2ms cached
- PostgreSQL baseline comparison

5. Compliance Features
- Immutable audit trails
- Real-time event streaming for monitoring
- Logical fund segregation support
- Regulatory reporting data structures

ARCHITECTURE
- API Gateway for external access
- Command Processing Service for transaction validation
- Event Store as single source of truth
- Read Model Projections for optimized queries
- Cryptographic Attestation Service
- FUSE Interface Layer
- Event Streaming Service

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Event Store, basic transactions)
Phase 2: Cryptographic Features (Merkle trees, proofs)
Phase 3: FUSE Integration (filesystem interface, read-only access)
Phase 4: Performance Optimization (projections, caching, benchmarking)
Phase 5: Compliance Features (streaming, advanced audit capabilities)

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Technical: >50K TPS, <100ms write latency, <50ms read latency, <10ms FUSE access
- Business: Full regulatory compliance demonstration, 100% cryptographic verifiability
- Innovation: Functional FUSE interface providing filesystem access to ledger data

DELIVERABLES
1. LedgerFS Core System with FUSE interface
2. Cryptographic Attestation Module
3. Performance Benchmarking Report vs PostgreSQL
4. Compliance Documentation
5. API and FUSE Interface Documentation
6. Automated Test Suite

The MVP validates that LedgerFS can outperform traditional RDBMS in audit-focused, high-throughput environments while providing innovative filesystem access to financial data through FUSE integration.
