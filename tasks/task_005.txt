# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Merkle Tree Generation and Chaining
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the cryptographic foundation of LedgerFS by creating Merkle trees for transaction batches and chaining them together to ensure ledger integrity.
# Details:
1. Implement SHA-256 hashing for individual transactions
2. Create Merkle tree construction algorithm
3. Implement batch processing for transaction Merkleization
4. Design and implement block structure containing:
   - Block ID
   - Timestamp
   - Previous block hash
   - Merkle root
   - Block metadata
5. Create chaining mechanism to link blocks cryptographically
6. Implement periodic digest generation
7. Add secure storage for digests outside primary system
8. Create verification mechanisms for chain integrity
9. Implement recovery procedures for chain verification failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for SHA-256 hashing implementation
2. Merkle tree construction and verification tests
3. Chain integrity tests with valid and invalid blocks
4. Performance tests for Merkle tree generation (target: process 50,000 TPS)
5. Digest generation and storage tests
6. Security tests attempting to tamper with the chain
