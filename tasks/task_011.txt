# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Transaction Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core transaction processing functionality including debit/credit operations, transfers, and transaction metadata management.
# Details:
1. Design transaction schema with required fields:

4. Implement transaction metadata management
5. Add transaction reference generation
6. Create transaction search and filtering
7. Implement transaction categorization
8. Add support for multi-currency transactions
9. Create batch transaction processing
10. Implement transaction limits and controls

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for transaction processing logic
2. Atomicity tests for transfers
3. Performance tests for transaction throughput (target: >50,000 TPS)
4. Concurrency tests for simultaneous transactions on same account
5. Integration tests with API Gateway
6. Error handling tests for invalid transactions
