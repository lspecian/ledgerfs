# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Proof Generation and Verification API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create API endpoints for generating and verifying cryptographic inclusion proofs for transactions and account balances against the published Merkle root.
# Details:
1. Design API endpoints for:
   - Generating inclusion proofs for transactions
   - Generating inclusion proofs for account balances
   - Verifying inclusion proofs against ledger digests
2. Implement Merkle proof generation algorithm
3. Create proof serialization/deserialization
4. Implement verification logic for proofs
5. Add caching for frequently requested proofs
6. Create documentation for proof format and verification process
7. Implement rate limiting for proof generation requests
8. Add metrics for proof generation and verification performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for proof generation algorithm
2. Verification tests with valid and invalid proofs
3. Performance tests for proof generation (target: <50ms per transaction)
4. API endpoint tests for correct responses
5. Load tests for concurrent proof requests
6. Integration tests with external verification tools
