# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Command Processing Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the service responsible for validating commands, ensuring business logic integrity, and writing events to the Event Store.
# Details:
1. Define command schema for core operations:
   - CreateAccount
   - DebitAccount
   - CreditAccount
   - TransferBetweenAccounts
2. Implement command validation logic
3. Create command handlers for each command type
4. Implement business logic validation (e.g., sufficient funds for debits)
5. Add idempotency handling to prevent duplicate processing
6. Create transaction boundaries for atomic operations
7. Implement error handling and response generation
8. Add logging for command processing
9. Create metrics collection for performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for command validation logic
2. Integration tests for end-to-end command processing
3. Performance tests for command throughput
4. Idempotency tests ensuring duplicate commands are handled correctly
5. Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
6. Business logic validation tests (e.g., insufficient funds)
