# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop API Gateway
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the entry point for external interactions with LedgerFS, handling authentication, authorization, and routing to appropriate services.
# Details:
1. Design RESTful API endpoints for:
   - Account management
   - Transaction processing
   - Balance inquiries
   - Transaction history
   - Proof generation and verification
2. Implement authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, API keys)
3. Create authorization rules based on roles and permissions
4. Implement request validation and sanitization
5. Add rate limiting and throttling
6. Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
7. Implement request logging and monitoring
8. Add error handling and standardized error responses
9. Implement versioning strategy for API endpoints

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for request validation
2. Authentication and authorization tests
3. Integration tests for end-to-end API flows
4. Performance tests for API throughput and latency
5. Security tests for authentication bypass attempts
6. Documentation tests ensuring OpenAPI spec matches implementation
