# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Read Model Projection Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop services that asynchronously consume events and project them into optimized read models for specific query patterns, implementing the CQRS pattern.
# Details:
1. Design read model schemas for common query patterns:
   - Account balance lookup
   - Transaction history by account
   - Transaction details by ID
2. Implement event consumers to process events from Event Store
3. Create projection logic to transform events into read models
4. Implement snapshotting mechanism for performance optimization
5. Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
6. Create query API for read models
7. Implement pagination for large result sets
8. Add sorting and filtering capabilities
9. Implement eventual consistency handling
10. Add metrics for read model performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for projection logic
2. Performance tests for read operations (target: <50ms P95 for balance queries)
3. Consistency tests ensuring read models reflect all processed events
4. Snapshot tests verifying correct state reconstruction
5. Cache hit/miss ratio tests
6. Load tests for concurrent read operations
