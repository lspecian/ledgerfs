# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Historical Data Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop capabilities for querying the raw event log and reconstructing account state at any point in time.
# Details:
1. Design query interface for event log access
2. Implement time-range based event queries
3. Create account-specific event filtering
4. Implement state reconstruction algorithm
5. Add snapshot-based optimization for faster reconstruction
6. Create point-in-time balance calculation
7. Implement transaction history generation
8. Add pagination for large result sets
9. Create sorting and filtering options
10. Implement audit trail generation

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for query interface
2. Performance tests for state reconstruction (with and without snapshots)
3. Accuracy tests comparing reconstructed state with expected values
4. Integration tests with API Gateway
5. Load tests for concurrent historical queries
6. Pagination tests with large datasets
