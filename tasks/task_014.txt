# Task ID: 14
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a suite of benchmarks to validate LedgerFS performance against the specified targets and PostgreSQL baseline.
# Details:
1. Design benchmark methodology for fair comparison
2. Implement PostgreSQL baseline with equivalent functionality
3. Create macro benchmarks for:
   - End-to-end transaction processing
   - Account state queries
   - FUSE filesystem access
4. Implement micro benchmarks for:
   - Event log operations
   - Hash chain operations
   - Snapshot operations
   - Merkle tree operations
5. Create compliance benchmarks for:
   - Proof generation and verification
   - Historical state reconstruction
   - Audit trail queries
6. Implement automated benchmark execution
7. Create visualization and reporting for benchmark results
8. Add CI integration for continuous performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Validation tests ensuring benchmark accuracy
2. Reproducibility tests across different environments
3. Statistical analysis of benchmark variability
4. Comparison tests against PostgreSQL baseline
5. Verification tests for performance targets:
   - >50,000 TPS for core ledger entries
   - <100ms P95 for ledger writes
   - <50ms P95 for balance queries
   - <10ms cold, <2ms cached for FUSE access
   - <50ms for proof generation
