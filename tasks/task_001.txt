2. Set up project structure with separate modules for:
   - API Gateway
   - Command Processing Service
   - Event Store
   - Read Model Projection Services

   - Proof Generation & Verification Service
   - Event Streaming Service
   - FUSE Interface
3. Configure build system (e.g., Gradle/Maven for JVM, or Cargo for Rust)
4. Set up dependency management
5. Initialize CI/CD pipeline with stages for build, test, benchmark
6. Create initial documentation structure
7. Set up logging framework with appropriate levels for production and development

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful build of empty project structure
2. Ensure CI pipeline runs successfully on commits
3. Validate project structure against architectural requirements
4. Test logging configuration in different environments
